# My Very First Web Page


## Welcome!

This is my first repository on Github and my first time using Git.
The web pages themselves were written in html and styled with css.

On the web pages, you will see the names and logos on the languages and
softwares I will be learning about on my Full Stack Web Development course with 
Code Institute, and if you click them, you will be taken to their wikipedia
pages for more information.
